# Advent of Code
My answers for Advent of Code. I'm improving the code before uploading.
Completeness per language is defined below.

** DEPRECATED ** - Remove the repos listed below as I move them to their own repos.

- ✔️ `Python`, migrate to UV
- `Java` and `Julia`, leave as it is
- `C++`, leave as it is

## [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

* ✔️ Python :star: x 50

### Wishlist

Improve the following functions:

```text
84.18s call     test_day_22.py::test_solve_1_input
36.60s call     test_day_20.py::test_solve_2_input
25.81s call     test_day_11.py::test_solve_2_examples[ghijklmn-ghjbbcdd]
25.44s call     test_day_11.py::test_solve_1_examples[ghijklmn-ghjaabcc]
17.01s call     test_day_10.py::test_solve_2_input
11.02s call     test_day_20.py::test_solve_1_input
10.56s call     test_day_06.py::test_solve_2_input
```

It will rework 3.5 minutes of 5 minutes.

## [2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016)

* ✔️ Python :star: x 50

### Wishlist

Improve the following functions:

```text
40.42s call     test_day_12.py::test_solve_2_input
34.97s call     test_day_25.py::test_solve_1_input
33.32s call     test_day_18.py::test_solve_2_input
32.61s call     test_day_16.py::test_solve_2_input
32.40s call     test_day_14.py::test_solve_2_examples
32.27s call     test_day_14.py::test_solve_2_input
```
It will rework 3 minutes of 4.5 minutes.

## [2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017)

* ✔️ Java :star: x 50

## [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

* C++ :star: x 32

## [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

* Python :star: x 10 - int coder puzzle, better to do in Rust - at least one AoC in Rust... Consider C as well.

## [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

* Julia :star: x 50
